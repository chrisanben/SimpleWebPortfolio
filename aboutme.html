					Dear Mr. [REDACTED]
					<br><br>
					I am applying for the Junior Web Developer Co-op position posted on [REDACTED]. I’d like to appreciate the opportunity that this is to discuss the position and candidacy for the job.
					<br>
					I am passionately looking to bring my well-developed problem solving, commitment, adaptability, teamwork and interpersonal communication skills internally to flourish as a web developer.
					<br>
					My skill qualifications complement the responsibilities outlined in the requirements of the job posting. I have been honing my teamwork and interpersonal skills by working with multiple people on projects as a team. As a young professional my adaptability and commitment to complete any task given to me has served previous employers dearly and it is guaranteed that it will greatly benefit your company. During my education as a web developer I have had the opportunity to work efficiently while under pressure and capable of making quick changes to any project that it was required of me to do. As a current student for Computer Programmer and Analyst Co-Op, I have a fresh mind to work in the business world for the benefit to the company.
					<br>
					I look forward to hearing from you in order to discuss this great opportunity in further detail or any future opportunity as Co-Op professional. I can be contacted at [REDACTED], if I’m not available, please do leave a message. Thank you for your consideration.
					<br><br>
					Sincerely,
					<br>
					Chris Bentley
